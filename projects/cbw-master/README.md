# CBW Master Multi-Agent Project

This is the **authoritative bundle** containing everything you need for the
multi-agent setup we worked on:

- OpenAI-style agent JSON configs
- CrewAI multi-agent bridge (Python)
- CrewAI YAML reference configs (agents + tasks)
- Docs from your uploads
- Minimal OpenAI-style tools + toolsets registry
- A launcher script to run the crew quickly

You can drop this folder into a Git repo, or just unzip and hack on it locally.
