 # Gemini CLI Blueprint

This repository contains a blueprint for a constitution-driven AI CLI agent
called **Gemini**, along with project templates, example tools, and tests.

 ## Contents

 - `GEMINI.md` – The core constitution and behavioral rules.
 - `templates/` – Project-level Markdown templates for consistent workflows.
 - `tools/` – Example Python tools, including an extension installer.
 - `config/` – Example configuration file for Gemini.
 - `tests/` – Skeleton tests for key components.

 ## Suggested Usage

 - Use `GEMINI.md` as the baseline contract for your Gemini CLI.
 - Copy templates into new projects and customize them.
 - Wire the tools into your CLI / agent runtime.
 - Extend tests to cover your real implementation.
